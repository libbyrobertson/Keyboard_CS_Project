This is the repository for my Project.
In this project I'm going to make music. 


# Overview
This project will convert a toy piano to play different music using MIDI
  - User will press a button and sound will come from the computer
  - User can switch between different music modes using a 3 position switch
  - With each different switch a different set of sounds will be played

# Goals
 - Have six sets of MIDI sounds
 - have led connected to the buttons as well although this may be in the distant future

# Critique
I am very much learning as I go and so much of the code is commented out at this point.I still plan on gaing knowledge on the MIDI system and being able to add much more to the code.

# Known Issues
The hardware is still being assembled. As mentioned there is currently slim to none knowledge of MIDI.

# Source Code
The source code can be found at a link as soon as I figure out how to do that.

#Hardware
Specific Hardware currently in my hands is needed for this project.
